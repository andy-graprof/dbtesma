 General Installation Information:
   Dbtesma builds have been reported successful on linux and windows machines - 
   I believe it should build fine on Mac too, but since I don't own one, I can't 
   test it. 
   Although, if you run into build issues on a Mac, you most likely need to 
   install the GNU versions of gcc and make to fix it.
   
   NOTE: the .zip and .tar releases contain the same code. I only provided 
     different archives for convenience reasons on different OS.
   
 Installation on Linux
   1.) install gcc and make
   2.) download and extract the source
   3.) run ./setup.sh
   4.) run make
 
 Installation on Windows
   You will most likely want to use the installer I provided. However, if you 
   want to build the dbtesma on your own, here are the instructions.
   
   1.) install gcc and make, add the binaries to PATH
     1.a) if you use the MinGW relase, remove the make binary, and install a 
	      proper GNU make.
   2.) download and extract the source
   3.) navigate to the source directory from a command line
   4.) run setup.bat
   5.) run make
   
 The dbtesma binary should now be located in the source folder.
 
 NOTE: For additional information on the dbtesma, refer to the bachelor thesis
   paper that is located in the docs directory of the source release.
